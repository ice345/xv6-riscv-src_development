# My xv6-riscv Learning Journey: When Mathematics Meets the Kernel

This repository is my personal version for learning and developing the xv6-riscv operating system. It is a hands-on project that combines mathematics, theoretical computer science, and practical system implementation.

The main goal of this project is to learn by doing. I will modify, experiment with, and add new features to the base xv6 system.

The focus of this project will be on my personal development based on some modifications I made to xv6, combined with abstract algebra, number theory and probability theory.

## About Original xv6

xv6 is a re-implementation of the Sixth Edition (v6) of Unix by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. xv6 closely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for modern RISC-V multiprocessors. This project is based on the RISC-V version of [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv).

All credit for the original xv6 goes to the MIT PDOS team and the many contributors to the project. For more information, please refer to the original [xv6 website](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/).

## Building and Running xv6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" [toolchain](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2024/tools.html)
